# Abstract
In every social science, the end goal is to find what factors contribute to happiness. Every year the United Nations conducts a global survey in which people from around 150 countries evaluate their lives. The end result of the survey is known as the World Happiness Report. One would assume that high GDP per capita will play a key role here, with countries having high GDP per capita ranking the highest. But the correlation is far from perfect. This project is an endeavor to find what really constitutes human happiness. We are using data from the World Happiness Report 2022.
